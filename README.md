# What is ElleHacks
ElleHacks is the largest hackathon created for women and non-binary individuals of all experience levels, it is an event lead entirely by students with a background in STEM fields, proposed to challenge participants from different technical and creative disciplines to collaborate, learn, compete and show off their skills to solve real life problems in an inclusive and safe space.

## My Experience
My first hackathon and what a wonderful experience! The organizers, the volunteers, the mentors, all of the sponsors were so helpful and amazing. The event held a career fair and workshops to provide us the tools to to develop our professional career. 

The event had a variety of challenges to choose from, all the themes/challenges are listed here https://ellehacks2020.hackerearth.com/

The three of us chose to create a educational simulation game about sustainability. We decided on using Javascipt, HTML and CSS.

## Would I do it Again ?
Absolutely ! I had doubts leading up to the event about attending because I was much older than the majority of partipants but thankfully I went. I had nothing to lose and everything to gain!
