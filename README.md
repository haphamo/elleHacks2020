# What is ElleHacks
ElleHacks is the largest hackathon created for women and non-binary individuals of all experience levels, it is an event lead entirely by students with a background in STEM fields, proposed to challenge participants from different technical and creative disciplines to collaborate, learn, compete and show off their skills to solve real life problems in an inclusive and safe space.

## Our Experience
For Ha and Hoa, it was their first experience. This was Vesa's second hackathon. It was overall a great experience for all of them
The organizers, the volunteers, the mentors, all of the sponsors were so helpful and amazing. The event held a career fair and workshops to provide the particpants with the tools to to develop their professional career. 

The event had a variety of challenges to choose from, all the themes/challenges are listed here https://ellehacks2020.hackerearth.com/

The three of them chose to create a educational simulation game about sustainability. They decided on using Javascipt, HTML and CSS.

## Would I do it Again ?
Absolutely !
